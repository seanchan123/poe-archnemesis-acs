### Updates Incoming (as of 12/02/22)

- Working on procuring more mods
    - Some modswithout braces like Kitava-touched are not implemented yet; templates from wiki didn't work and I went around asking for screenshots but to no avail.
- Working search function
    - Waiting for procuring of all available mods to start working on search, works by typing in the overlay and darkening non-searched mods.
- Changeable hotkeys
    - As of right now, CTRL + SHIFT + A to show the overlay and CTRL + SHIFT + S to scan.
- Working on System Tray menu
    - Only an icon of the tool is in the overlay with the name as it's tooltip without any menu to exit etc.
